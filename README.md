# ProtoJ
A wrapper on Java's com.sun.net.HttpServer and related classes

ProtoJ is a prototyping server, built to make coding a simple server in Java fast and effortless. It is unsuitable for production at the moment, and is not meant to be suitable for production, but if it can be in the future, that'd be great.

ProtoJ should compile for Java 8 and Java 7, but it was written for Java 8. In the near future, build.xml will be modified to allow for testing both on Java 7 and 8 compilers.
